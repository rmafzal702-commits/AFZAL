                        <h2>Your Privacy Matters</h2>
                        <p>At ToolGoAI, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle
                            information when you use our website and tools. The short version: <strong>We don't collect,
                                store, or transmit any of your personal data.</strong> All our tools run entirely in
                            your browser, ensuring your complete privacy.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>1. Information We Don't Collect</h2>
                    <p>Unlike many websites, ToolGoAI is designed with privacy as a core principle. We want to be
                        crystal clear about what we DON'T do:</p>

                    <ul class="privacy-list">
                        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect names, email addresses, phone
                            numbers, or any other personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily provide it
                            through our contact form.</li>
                        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We do not track which tools you use, how often you use them, or
                            what data you process with our tools.</li>
                        <li><strong>File Content:</strong> Any files you upload or process using our tools remain
                            entirely on your device. We never see, store, or have access to your files.</li>
                        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We do not collect or track your geographic location.</li>
                        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We do not collect information about your device,
                            browser, or operating system.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>2. How Our Tools Work</h2>
                    <p>All tools on ToolGoAI are built using client-side technology, which means they run entirely in
                        your web browser. When you use any of our tools:</p>

                    <ul class="privacy-list">
                        <li>All processing happens locally on your device</li>
                        <li>No data is sent to our servers or any third-party servers</li>
                        <li>Your files and text never leave your computer</li>
                        <li>Results are generated instantly without any network communication</li>
                        <li>You can even use our tools offline once the page is loaded</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This architecture ensures that your data remains completely private and secure. We physically
                        cannot access your data because it never reaches our servers.</p>

                    <h2>3. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
                    <p>ToolGoAI uses minimal cookies and local storage for essential functionality only:</p>

                    <h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
                    <p>We may use essential cookies to remember your preferences, such as theme selection or tool
                        settings. These cookies:</p>
                    <ul class="privacy-list">
                        <li>Are stored only on your device</li>
                        <li>Do not track your behavior</li>
                        <li>Can be deleted at any time through your browser settings</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Third-Party Cookies</h3>

                        use cookies to serve relevant ads. These third-party cookies are governed by the respective
                        privacy policies of:</p>

                    <h2>4. Contact Form</h2>
                    <p>When you submit our contact form, you voluntarily provide information such as your name, email
                        address, and message. This information:</p>

                    </ul>

                    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
                    <p>ToolGoAI may contain links to external websites or use third-party services for specific
                        functionality:</p>

                    <h3>Advertising Networks</h3>
                    <p>We partner with Google AdSense and Adsterra to display advertisements. These services may collect
                        information about your visits to our website and other websites to provide relevant
                        advertisements. We do not control these third-party cookies or tracking technologies.</p>

                    <h3>External Links</h3>
                    <p>Our website may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy
                        practices of these external sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any
                        third-party sites you visit.</p>

                    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
                    <p>ToolGoAI is designed to be safe for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal
                        information from children under the age of 13. Since we don't collect personal data from any
                        users, this policy applies universally. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child
                        has provided us with personal information through our contact form, please contact us, and we
                        will delete such information promptly.</p>

                    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
                    <p>While we don't collect or store your data, we still take security seriously:</p>

                    <ul class="privacy-list">
                        <li>Our website uses HTTPS encryption to protect data in transit</li>
                        <li>All tools run client-side, eliminating server-side vulnerabilities</li>
                        <li>We regularly update our codebase to address security issues</li>
                        <li>We follow industry best practices for web security</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>8. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
                    <p>Since we don't collect or store personal data, there's no data for you to access, modify, or
                        delete. However, you have the following rights:</p>

                    <ul class="privacy-list">
                        <li><strong>Browser Settings:</strong> You can clear cookies and local storage through your
                            browser settings</li>
                        <li><strong>Ad Preferences:</strong> You can opt out of personalized advertising through ad

                            through our contact form</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>9. International Users</h2>
                    <p>ToolGoAI is accessible worldwide. Since all processing happens in your browser and we don't
                        collect data, there are no international data transfer concerns. Our privacy practices comply
                        with major privacy regulations including GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA
                        (California Consumer Privacy Act).</p>

                    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal
                        requirements. When we make changes:</p>

                    <ul class="privacy-list">

                    </ul>

                    <p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect
                        your privacy.</p>

                    <h2>11. Google AdSense Compliance</h2>
                    <p>As a website displaying Google AdSense advertisements, we comply with Google's policies:</p>
