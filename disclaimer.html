                        designed for general use and should not be relied upon for critical decisions without
                        independent verification.</p>

                    <p>Specifically:</p>

                    </ul>

                    <p>Users are responsible for verifying the accuracy of results generated by our tools, especially
                        when using them for important or critical purposes. We recommend cross-checking results with
                        other sources or professional tools when accuracy is essential.</p>

                    <h2>4. Use at Your Own Risk</h2>
